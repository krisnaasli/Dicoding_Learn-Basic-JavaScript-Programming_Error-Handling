# Description 
### There are main.js programs as follows:
#### * Coding Quiz: Error Handling (main.js)
This program consists of a detectTriangle function that aims to detect the type of triangle based on the value of the given argument. In addition, there are two additional classes, ValidationError and validateNumberInput, and logic to validate the input before executing the detectTriangle function.
The purpose of this program is to improve the detectTriangle function so that it can function according to the expected conditions. This is done by validating the function's input arguments so that if they do not match, an appropriate error will be thrown. Thus, the program can give a specific error message if the input is not qualified, resulting in a better and more informative solution.
So, this program is a JavaScript script that aims to detect the type of triangle based on the given side length, by adding input validation to ensure the match of input data type before executing the main function, as well as handling errors by providing relevant and informative messages to the user.
